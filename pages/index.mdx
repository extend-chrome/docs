# What is Extend Chrome?

**Extend Chrome** is a GitHub organization dedicated to making **Chrome
extension** development smarter.

</div>

## Better Build Tools

Check out our low-config Chrome extension **bundling solution**, <Link href="/rollup-plugin">rollup-plugin-chrome-extension</Link>.\
It extracts files from the Chrome extension manifest, so adding new files is as easy as updating your `manifest.json`.

The reviewers will love your bundle, because Rollup produces a
**human readable build**. This means less of a chance to get a false
rejection for obfuscation, just because the reviewer can't understand
your bundled code.

## Smarter Messages and Storage

Take advantage of **TypeScript** with our Chrome extension <Link href="/messages">message</Link>
and <Link href="/storage">storage</Link> libraries. Both are fully
typed, so you can define message types and even split your storage into
typed buckets.

## Easier Testing

Mock the **Chrome API** with <Link href="/jest-chrome">jest-chrome</Link>.
This library provides a full mock of the Chrome API. Just define your
function implementation and you're ready to go!
