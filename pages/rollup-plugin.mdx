Build Chrome Extensions using
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/), with
[minimal configuration](https://www.extend-chrome.dev/rollup-plugin#usage).

Here are some of the things this Rollup plugin does:

<TagCloud />

Use `manifest.json` as the input. Every file in the manifest will
be bundled or copied to the output folder.

## Looking for Vite support?

Vite support is in beta! [Get started with HMR and React in 90 seconds.](https://dev.to/jacksteamdev/create-a-vite-react-chrome-extension-in-90-seconds-3df7)
The documentation on this site does not cover Vite, but you can [get help on GitHub.](https://github.com/extend-chrome/rollup-plugin-chrome-extension/discussions/136)

## Getting started

### Chrome Extension Boilerplates

We have TypeScript and JavaScript boilerplates available.

Get started fast with the
[JavaScript React boilerplate](https://github.com/extend-chrome/js-react-boilerplate):

```
git clone https://github.com/extend-chrome/js-react-boilerplate.git
```

Or use the [TypeScript React boilerplate](https://github.com/extend-chrome/ts-react-boilerplate) if you're feeling
fancy:

```
git clone https://github.com/extend-chrome/ts-react-boilerplate.git
```

Special thanks to [@kyrelldixon](https://www.kyrelldixon.com/) for this [Svelte and Tailwind CSS boilerplate with optional TypeScript support](https://github.com/kyrelldixon/svelte-tailwind-extension-boilerplate):

```
git clone https://github.com/kyrelldixon/svelte-tailwind-extension-boilerplate.git
```

### Install

```sh
npm i rollup rollup-plugin-chrome-extension@latest -D
```

Install the plugins
[Node Resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-node-resolve)
and [CommonJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-commonjs)
if you plan to use npm modules.

```sh
npm i @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-commonjs -D
```

## Usage

Create a `rollup.config.js` file in your project root.

```javascript
// rollup.config.js

import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve'
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs'

import { chromeExtension, simpleReloader } from 'rollup-plugin-chrome-extension'

export default {
  input: 'src/manifest.json',
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',
    format: 'esm',
  },
  plugins: [
    // always put chromeExtension() before other plugins
    chromeExtension(),
    simpleReloader(),
    // the plugins below are optional
    resolve(),
    commonjs(),
  ],
}
```

Add these scripts to your `package.json` file.

```jsonc
// package.json

{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c",
    "start": "rollup -c -w"
  }
}
```

Put your Chrome extension source code in a folder named `src` in
the root of your project and build with the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

Your extension build will be in the `dist` folder. It has
everything it needs: manifest, scripts, and assets (images, CSS,
etc.).

Load it in Chrome `chrome://extensions/` to test drive your extension!

## Features

### It's all in the manifest

<TagAnchor value="Parse manifest.json" count={35} />

#### Why does the `rollup.config.js` only need the manifest as an entry point?

`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` parses your manifest and bundles the scripts in
your background page, content scripts, options page, and popup page

#### What about HTML pages, like popup or options?

<TagAnchor value="Parse HTML pages" count={35} />

`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` uses the JS or even TS files in your HTML files
as entry points. Shared code is split out into chunks automatically, so
libraries like React and Lodash aren't bundled into your extension multiple
times.

#### What about the assets? Like images, icons, or CSS files?

<TagAnchor value="Copy assets" count={25} />

All assets declared in the manifest (including files in
`web_accessible_resources`, any image, icon, font, and even CSS files) are
automatically copied into the output folder. Even the images in your HTML files
get copied over. NOTE: This only includes assets in the HTML itself. If you
import images or CSS in a JavaScript file, you will need an additional plugin.

<BackToTop />

### Is the Manifest validated?

<TagAnchor value="Validate the manifest" count={28} />

`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` validates your output manifest, so you discover
mistakes when you build, not in a cryptic Chrome alert later.

<BackToTop />

### Does it detect permissions automatically?

<TagAnchor value="Detect permissions" count={24} />

`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` statically analyzes your bundled code, detects
any required permissions, and adds them to the manifest in the `dist` folder. Any
permissions in the source manifest are always included.

<BackToTop />

### Do I have to copy/paste the package.json fields to the manifest?

<TagAnchor value="Update manifest version" count={15} />

You can omit `manifest_version`, `version`, `name`, and `description` from your source
`manifest.json`. We'll fill them out automatically from your `package.json` if you
use an npm script to run Rollup. Just manage your version number in `package.json`
and it will reflect in your extension build.

Don't worry. Any value in your source manifest will be used first! ðŸ˜‰

<BackToTop />

### What about Manifest Version 3?

<TagAnchor value="Manifest Version 3" count={50} />

[Manifest Version 3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) is here! Google is recommending that developers adopt the new format as soon as possible, and `rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` is fully compatible with Manifest Version 3.

Just follow the [migration guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-migration/), setting `manifest_version` to `3`, and we've got your back! No additional Rollup configuration is required.

<BackToTop />

### Reload Your Extension Automatically

<TagAnchor value="Auto Reloader" count={75} />

#### Does this mean I don't have to manually reload my extension during development?

Improve your development experience with our reloader! You won't have to reload
your Chrome extension every time you make a change to your code. We know what a
pain it can be to forget and wonder, "Why isn't this change working? ðŸ˜Ÿ".

#### Does it also reload the pages I am injecting content scripts?

Ever got the error `"Extension context invalidated"` in your content script?
It happens when the extension reloads, but the content script doesn't. Our
reloader makes sure that doesn't happen by reloading your content scripts when
it reloads your extension automatically.

#### How do I enable the reloader?

If you include the helper plugin `simpleReloader` in your config, your background page will include an auto-reloader script when Rollup is in watch mode. This
will reload your extension every time Rollup produces a new build.

<BackToTop />

### Write Chrome Extensions In TypeScript

<TagAnchor value="TypeScript" count={50} />

If you use
[`@rollup/plugin-typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-typescript),
you can write your Chrome extension in TypeScript. That's right. It bundles the scripts in your manifest and in your HTML script
tags.

Be sure to install [`@types/chrome`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/chrome) to add TypeScript support for the Chrome API.

#### Can I write my Manifest in TypeScript?

<TagAnchor value="Alternate manifest formats" count={35} />

Yes, you can! You can even use environment variables. Just make sure your manifest file name starts with `manifest` so we don't include it in the build files.

```typescript
import { ManifestV3 } from 'rollup-plugin-chrome-extension'

const manifest: ManifestV3 = {
  manifest_version: 3,
  background: {
    service_worker: 'service-worker.ts',
  },
  content_scripts: [
    {
      js: ['content-script.ts'],
      matches: ['https://*.example.com/*'],
    },
  ],
}

export default manifest
```

### Use ES2015 Modules In Your Scripts

<TagAnchor value="ESM" count={45} />

Chrome extensions don't support modules in content
scripts. We've created a module loader specifically for Chrome
extension scripts, so you can take advantage of Rollup's great
code-splitting features. It's enabled by default!

<BackToTop />

---

### What About Firefox Support?

Until v89, [Firefox did not support dynamic imports in web extensions](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1536094),
so any scripts needed to be in another format, like IIFE.
The suggested solution was to run Parcel on the Rollup output, but
this wonâ€™t be necessary once **Firefox v89** is [released](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/89.0/releasenotes/).

<BackToTop />

### Use Promises like it's 2021

<TagAnchor value="Promises" count={15} />

Add the excellent [promisified Browser API polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) by Mozilla to your
Chrome extension with one easy option:

```javascript
chromeExtension({ browserPolyfill: true })
```

This option adds `browser` to the global scope, so you don't need to import anything.

[Install this type package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/firefox-webext-browser) to get Intellisense. It's automatically updated on a regular basis.

<BackToTop />

### Plugins Take It To The Next Level

Take advantage of other great Rollup plugins to do awesome things
with your Chrome extensions!

Some of our favorites are:

- Write your extension in TS with
  [`@rollup/plugin-typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-typescript)
- Import CSS in JS files with
  [`rollup-plugin-postcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-postcss)
- Zip your extension when you build with
  [`rollup-plugin-zip`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-zip).
- Copy any assets not included in the manifest.json
  [`rollup-plugin-copy`](https://github.com/vladshcherbin/rollup-plugin-copy).

Two of our own plugins:

- Import a module as a string of code to use in
  `chrome.runtime.executeScript` with
  [`rollup-plugin-bundle-imports`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-bundle-imports)
- Empty your output folder before a new build with
  [`rollup-plugin-empty-dir`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-empty-dir)

<BackToTop />

### Outputs a Chrome Web Store friendly bundle

<TagAnchor value="Chrome Web Store friendly" count={27} />

Every time you publish your Chrome extension to the Web Store,
your extension will be reviewed by a robot and then a human to
make sure it meets their guidelines. Even if you pass when you
first publish, your extension may be flagged at any time.
`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` helps you put your best foot
forward.

Wrong permissions are the number one reason that Chrome
extensions are rejected from the Chrome Web Store.
`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` can detect most of the commonly
used permissions in your code automatically, so you only need to
add a permission manually if you absolutely know that you need
it.

Imagine the person who reviews the code you submit. Common
bundling options like webpack and Parcel produce code that is
really hard to read. Rollup produces code that is easy to read!
When you submit your extension for review, you want to avoid
misunderstandings.

Rollup produces a nice clean bundle using code splitting, ES
modules, and tree-shaking. If you don't use some piece of code,
Rollup removes it. If you use a module in more than once place,
Rollup splits it out into a chunk, so that it's only in your
extension once.

All of this means a smaller Chrome extension. We've seen Chrome
extensions go from over 8Mb to less than 1Mb just by switching
from `create-react-app` to Rollup. A smaller bundle means less
code to review, and less room for error during the review
process.

## API

`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension` works out of the box, but
sometimes you need more.

### Exports

#### `chromeExtension`

Call this function to initialize
`rollup-plugin-chrome-extension`. Always put it first in the
plugins array, since it converts the manifest json file to an
array of input files. See [Options API](#options-api) for config
details.

```javascript
// rollup.config.js

import { chromeExtension } from 'rollup-plugin-chrome-extension'

export default {
  input: 'src/manifest.json',
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',
    format: 'esm',
  },
  plugins: [chromeExtension()],
}
```

#### `simpleReloader`

This reloader simply uses `setInterval` to fetch a local
timestamp file every few seconds. When Rollup completes a new
build, it changes the timestamp and the Chrome extension reloads
itself.

If Rollup is not in watch mode, `simpleReloader` disables
itself`.

Make sure to do your final build outside of watch mode so that it
doesn't include the reloader.

#### Usage for `simpleReloader`

```javascript
import { chromeExtension, simpleReloader } from 'rollup-plugin-chrome-extension'

export default {
  input: 'src/manifest.json',
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',
    format: 'esm',
  },
  plugins: [
    chromeExtension(),
    // Reloader goes after the main plugin
    simpleReloader(),
  ],
}
```

Start Rollup in watch mode. Enjoy auto-reloading whenever Rollup
makes a new build.

### Manifest API

#### `[permissions]`

**If a wrong permission has been detected**

Sometimes a third-party module will reference a Chrome API to
detect its environment, but you don't need the permission in your
manifest.

```jsonc
// wrong permissions in output manifest.json
{
  "permissions": [
    "alarms", // This should not be here
    "storage"
  ]
}
```

**Solution:** Prefix unwanted permissions in the manifest with
`"!"`, for example, `"!alarms"`.

```jsonc
// source manifest.json
{
  "permissions": [
    "!alarms", // This permission will be excluded
    "storage"
  ]
}
```

```jsonc
// correct permissions in output manifest.json
{
  "permissions": ["storage"]
}
```

#### `[web_accessible_resources]`

If you have files that are not imported to a script, or
referenced directly in the manifest or an HTML file, add them to
`web_accessible_resources`.

They will be written to `output.dir` with the same folder
structure as the source folder (the folder with the manifest
file). Relative paths may not lead outside of the source folder.

```jsonc
{
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    "fonts/some_font.oft",
    // HTML files are parsed like any other HTML file.
    "options2.html",
    // Globs are supported too!
    "**/*.png"
  ]
}
```

### Options API

You can use an options object with any of the following
properties. Everything is optional.

#### `[browserPolyfill]`

Add the excellent [promisified Browser API](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) by Mozilla to your
Chrome extension with one easy option:

```javascript
chromeExtension({
  browserPolyfill: true,
})
```

Don't forget to
[install types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/firefox-webext-browser)
if you want Intellisense to work!

### `[dynamicImportWrapper]`

We use dynamic imports to support ES2015 modules and
[code splitting](https://medium.com/rollup/rollup-now-has-code-splitting-and-we-need-your-help-46defd901c82)
for JS files.

[Use modules in Chrome extension scripts](). Only disable if you
know what you're doing, because code splitting won't work if
`dynamicImportWrapper === false`.

**Why do we need to use dynamic import in scripts?**
Two things are going on here:
This Rollup plugin leverages two Rollup features to parse the manifest into inputs:

- It adds multiple parsed files to options.input
- It uses options.output.dir to support multiple output files.
  This means that [Rollup will use code-splitting](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/2756#issuecomment-476242982). This is great because it makes a smaller bundle with no overlapping code, but we need a way to load those chunks into our content and background scripts.
  After some experimentation, I found that ES modules are the best format for web extensions, but they donâ€™t support ES modules in background or content scripts out of the box.

The solution is to use [dynamic imports](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53033388/4842857) in extension scripts. All Chromium browsers and Firefox 89+ (coming May 2021) support this.

#### `[dynamicImportWrapper.wakeEvents]`

Events that wake (reactivate) an extension may be lost if that
extension uses dynamic imports to load modules or asynchronously
adds event listeners.

The script module loader will defer them until after all the
background script modules have fully loaded. Once this is complete,
the listeners are removed.

By default the module loader will iterate through the events
available on the Chrome API object and add listeners to each one.
Since the manifest permissions determine which Chrome namespaces
are available, only a small superset of the events you use will be
used.

If you want to limit the number of events that the module loader
uses, you can list the events that should wake your background page
(for example, `'chrome.tabs.onUpdated'`, or `'chrome.runtime.onInstalled'`).

```javascript
// Example usage
chromeExtension({
  dynamicImportWrapper: {
    wakeEvents: ['chrome.contextMenus.onClicked'],
  },
})
```

#### `[dynamicImportWrapper.eventDelay]`

Delay Event page wake events by `n` milliseconds after the all
background page modules have finished loading. This may be useful
for event listeners that are added asynchronously.

```javascript
chromeExtension({
  dynamicImportWrapper: {
    eventDelay: 50,
  },
})
```

#### `[verbose]`

Set to `false` to suppress "Detected permissions" message.

```javascript
// Example usage
chromeExtension({
  verbose: false,
})

// Default value
chromeExtension({
  verbose: true,
})
```

#### `[pkg]`

Only use this field if you will not run Rollup using npm scripts
(for example, `$ npm run build`), since npm provides scripts with
the package info as an environment variable.

The fields `name`, `description`, and `version` are used.

These values are used to derive certain values from the
`package.json` for the extension manifest. A value set in the
source `manifest.json` will override a value from `package.json`.

```javascript
// Example usage
const packageJson = require('./package.json')

chromeExtension({
  // Not needed if you use npm to run Rollup
  pkg: packageJson,
})

// Default value
chromeExtension({
  // Can be omitted if run using an npm script
})
```

#### `[publicKey]` (deprecated)

If truthy, `manifest.key` will be set to this value. Use this
feature to
[stabilize the extension id during development](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31422195/keep-chrome-extension-id-same-during-development).

> Note that this value is not the actual id. An extension id is
> derived from this value.

```javascript
const p = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'

// Example usage
chromeExtension({
  publicKey: !p && 'mypublickey',
})
```
